Begin_ride:

"open app" and "log in" and "browse bikes" (maybe) is 
	out of scope of this use case
	
there is no "begin ride" usecase in your use case diagram

"try to unlock bike" implies it can fail, but diagram doesnt show that

beginning a ride should only start the billed __period__ of the ride

"authorize payment" is out of scope of this usecase, that should happen at the
	end of the ride
	
"Begin ride" is an action in the "Begin ride" activity 


Register_new_account:
	
"Fill registration form" is not an atomic action. I would suggest a fork with
	different form fields (such as: Name, Surname, Email ...)

something like "validate registration form" should be preceding "is form valid"

there should be a merge node between "Open registration form" 
	and "Fill registration form" to which an arrow from decision node 
	should point to

interaction with the database should be modeled (maybe ðŸ¤·)
